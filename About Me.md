# About Me
I'm a decent guy, got 1-4 hours of free time a day, I was born and live in denmark, I dropped out of school, Learned english as a 10 year old, English is my second language allthough I know more english vocabulary than danish.

The way I got into programming is kind of funny, Around 2 & 1/2 years ago i stumbled upon this danish server where you could use ingame currency to buy stuff on subservers. It was a lot like minehut, with player-run servers. Originally they banned all Tebex Shops but then they changed it, making you able to earn money with tebex. I then wanted to set it up with my server, and they recommended "Skript" to connected purchases with the server, I never made it work but i did develop an interest for Skriping.

Ever since then I've learned a bunch of things about the language, Created 3 of my own SMP's using it.
